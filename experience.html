          professional career has been spent in Business Development, working with C-Level Executives helping them craft startegies
          around enterprise level IT purchasing. These responsibilities included managing multi-year, multi-million dollar IT projects,
          managing teams of IT partners, and being the glue that makes IT projects successful. I've also aquired additionl tech skills
          throughout my projessional career including UX Testing, Salesforce Administration, Website Development and Management.
